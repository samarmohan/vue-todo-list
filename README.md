# React vs Vue

### What is this?

I built two identical todo lists using Vue and React. They use the same styling, fetch data from the same [database](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), have the same functionality, and the same pages. The only differences are the title and the about page.

### How to use this

You can clone the repo and mess around with the code or you can just browse the GitHub code.

### Contributing

This repo is for the community and is not going to be accepting and new features. Only create and issue or pull request if there is a bug or security flaw.

### Status

I am working on deployment and I will put the links in the README as soon as I am done.
